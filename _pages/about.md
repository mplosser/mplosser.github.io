I am a quantitative researcher in Citadel LLC's Equity Quantitative Research group. Previously, I spent over a decade at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York researching banking, financial intermediation, household finance, financial stability, and monetary policy. My policy roles included coordinating financial briefings to the NY Fed president, organizing the Financial Advisory Roundtable, and developing stress testing models. I have taught corporate finance at Princeton University as a Visiting Lecturer.
