  abstract={Conventional measures of bank solvency fail to account for liquidity risks posed by deposits. Using public regulatory data, we develop economic capital, a framework that jointly quantifies credit, liquidity, and market risk. Economic capital identifies banks that fail years in advance, including those in March 2023, while book capital deteriorates just before failure. Predictive power comes from valuing liabilities, which are elevated long before asset impairment. The framework informs assessments of stabilization policies, credit provision, and financial stability --- for example, following the Global Financial Crisis low rates depressed economic capital even as interest rate and liquidity risks grew.},
